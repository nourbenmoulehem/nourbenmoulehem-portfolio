    title: "WeBank Accessible",
    description: "As a Mobile Development Intern at Attijari Bank’s Head Office, I designed an accessible mobile application adhering to WCAG guidelines, leading to a 20% increase in user accessibility scores during testing. The project involved developing the app with React Native, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL, integrating a BERT-based intent recognition model to create a virtual assistant for users with disabilities. Additionally, I built an administration interface using React and Spring Boot to streamline client request management. Collaborating with the Ibsar Association, I gained valuable insights into accessibility and conducted usability tests with a visually impaired user. To enhance performance and scalability, I implemented Redux for state management. Throughout the project, I followed the Scrum methodology and utilized Notion for task management, ensuring an efficient workflow. This project served as my end-of-studies internship, focusing on inclusive and user-friendly banking solutions.",

    title: "React Client dashbaord",
    description: "During my summer internship at Attijari Bank’s Head Office, I developed interactive dashboards to track user engagement metrics, providing valuable insights into user behavior. I implemented JWT-based authorization to ensure secure access to user data and enhance application security. Additionally, I designed a role-based access control system, tailoring user experiences based on their roles. To improve communication within the platform, I integrated a real-time chat system. The project was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, Node.js), leveraging modern web technologies for scalability and efficiency.",
